* My texmf files
Here are all the user packages and configurations I use in my texmf folder. It
complies with the standard folder structure. Feel free to use whatever nuggets
you find useful.

The most useful file in here is probably my style for notes [[https://github.com/gcman/texmf/blob/master/tex/latex/local/gm-notes.org][gm-notes]], inspired
by tufte-latex.
